Cuisine Connect

Cuisine connect is my database project of 2-2. I used oracle database for this project. Also, I used svelte for frontend and node for backend. 

It is a simple project. The goal of this project is to connect all restaurants and customers in a single platform. It is the place for food lovers and businessmen alike. 

Here anyone can share their thought about any restaurant they like, can upload photos and review any of the dishes separately. Also, restaurant owners can open their separate profile, they can upload the menu in there, and take orders. Customers can learn about the reputation of each dish of a restaurant by reviewing the ratings provided by previous customers. 

Here customers can also find closest restaurants from their location quickly. They can find the restaurants by one click and enjoy without any hassle.
